extends index
//- better have that first line or none of this will work!

   ***************************************************************************
   I have set this layout up so that you never need to do a "block appends"
   But, you do need to include each block, even if it is empty, so that you
   don't load unecessary code from index (although it won't break anything)
   ***************************************************************************

block metas
   //- meta(name='description', content='This is an example description!')
      Here you can dynamically control the meta tags for each page
      This is especially useful for social networking sites like facebook that grab information
      from these meta tags to determine how links to your site appear on their site

      Keep in mind that index is providing these for each page already:
      meta(name='viewport', content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0')
      meta(name='title', content='#{title}')
         

block afterNav
   //- This is where the page content goes
      Please remember that everything here is inside of a container-fluid
      You should use row-fluid divs inside of here
   div.row-fluid   
      h3 Under Construction
   div.row-fluid
      p Something awesome will be here soon!

block modals
   //- this is where you can add hidden divs and other elements that you'll want to display
      dynamically on the page. 

block pageScripts
   //- This is where any page specific scripts go   
      Keep in mind that these are included in every page already:
      script(src='/js/jquery.min.js')
      script(src='/js/bootstrap.min.js')
